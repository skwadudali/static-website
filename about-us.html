        this website is about a gym center,which is run by my friend dibandu ghosh.
        you can contact us on the given number.
        thank you for join our gym center.
        A performer completes a specific number of repetitions and sets depending on their goals. The intensity of weight training can be calculated through working out your one max rep and then working at a percentage of their one max rep.

To develop strength and power, an individual will perform 3-5 sets of 3-5 reps at 85-95 % of their 1 rep max rep
To develop muscular hypertrophy (increased muscle size and strength) an individual will perform 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps at 70-80 % 1 rep max
To develop muscular endurance, an individual will perform 2-3 sets of 12-20 reps at approximately 60 % of their 1 rep max.
The idea of resistance training is to contract a muscle against a resistance. The exercises selected must relate to the muscle groups used in sport and your training goals. A sprint cyclist, for example, would focus on strength training in their leg muscles. Often, 6-8 exercises are performed, starting with compound (large) exercises such as the squat, deadlift or bent over rows and finishing with isolation (small) exercises such as bicep curls or lateral raises.

Example of a whole-body muscular hypertrophy training session. Perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions of the following exercises with 2 minutes rest in between sets.

Squat
Chest press
Lunge
Bent over row
Shoulder press
Bicep curl
Leg extension

 
Plyometric training
Plyometric training is used to increase power (strength x speed) and strength, this translates to higher jumps and faster sprint times. It typically involves bounding, hopping or jumping style exercises but can include medicine ball work or box work.

Plyometric training involves an eccentric (lowering and landing) contraction where muscles lengthen under tension (downward phase of a squat) followed by a concentric contraction, where muscles shorten under tension (upwards phase of a squat).

The eccentric phase, or landing phases, involves the pre-loading of the agonist muscle, the concentric phase, or take-off phase, uses the stored energy to increase the force of movement, resulting in a more powerful contraction. This type of training is very demanding on the body, usually, 3-5 sets of 3-5 repetitions are performed. Read more on plyometric training
